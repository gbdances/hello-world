Just another repository

Hi everyone!

John here. I've got over 30 years of software development experience, including a start using TRS-80, Kaypro, and Apple IIe machines with Basic and even some IBM/4 experience using RPG-II keypunch cards. My focus for the past 20 years has been building database-driven apps in Visual Studio (VB.NET and C#.NET hosted on Azure, driving by MS SQL Server, with of course HMTL, CSS, Javascript, and some jQuery, and Bootstrap). I'm also learning Python and some Java, as well as getting acquainted with AWS and Salesforce.
